1.	Uses CV to detect object then classify it by its color

2.	Uses 3-D points from camera to find object depth and move to that location

3.	Use IK and FK to move end effector from its starting configuration to its ending configuration to pick up object. 

    a.	End effector engagement

        i.	Maintain grip until it goes to bin

4.	Use CV again to calculate new starting position and ending position of end effector

5.	Recalculate end effector position to take object from its original location and put it in a bin.
